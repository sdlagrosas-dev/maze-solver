# maze-solver
A 2D matrix maze solver in Python.

This project is based on a tutorial on [boot.dev](https://boot.dev).

## Features

- Create 2D matrices of arbitrary size
- Test different path searching algorithms
- Visualize the results

## Algorithms

- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A* Algorithm

## Visualizing the results

- The results are visualized using Tkinter
- The path is shown in red
- The start is shown in green
- The end is shown in blue

## How to use

- Clone the repository
- Install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the program with `python main.py`
